# JSON 101

# JSON (and not Jason)

JSON is a text-based format for data interchange between programs.

* Between Server and Web browser
* From Server to Server
* From Today to Tomorrow (i.e. storage)

The name is a contraction of the phrase **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation



---

# What Does it Look Like?

```
{}

null

["apple", "banana", 55]

{"name":"Don", "height": 4.78e23}
```

---

# What are these?

There are 7 types of _values_ in a JSON document.

* `null`
* `false`
* `true`
* a _number_ :   `45.67`
* a _string_ :   `"hello there \u2655"`
* an _array_ :   `[1, 2, 3, "four"]`
* an _object_ :  `{ "results": [0, 42] }`


Most interchanged JSON documents use utf-8.

---

# Working with JSON

JSON is a way to transfer information.

* Converting your program data into JSON is called **encoding** or **serializing**.
* Converting JSON into an in-memory data structure is called **decoding** or **deserializing**.

It provides a common way to exchange data between programs in different languages.

# Python Example

Decode a JSON text:

```python
import json

json_data = """
    ["foo", "bar", 5, 42]
"""

v = json.loads(json_data)
```

Now `v` holds `['foo', 'bar', 5, 42]`

---

# Python Example (Cont)

Encode a JSON variable:

```python
import json

v = ['foo', 'bar', 5, 42]

json_data = json.dumps(v)
```

Now `json_data` holds the string `'["foo","bar",5,42]'`


---

# Javascript Example

Decode JSON:

```javascript
json_data  = "[34,45,56]"
v = JSON.parse(json_data)
```

Now `v` is a list with `v[0] = 34`, `v[1] = 45`, and `v[2] = 56`

Encode JSON:

```javascript
v = {"age": 78}
json_data = JSON.stringify(v)
```
`json_data` now holds the string `"{\"age\":78}"`

---

# Situations — Dates

JSON does not include a date type. The usual way around this is to format dates
as a string in RFC 3339 or ISO-8601 format.

```
"2018-03-24T12:00:00-04"
```



Some APIs might use the number of seconds since midnight January 1, 1970 (aka the unix epoch).

```
1521921600
```

What time is this? You can find out using the command line:

```
$ date -j -f "%s" 1521921600
Sat Mar 24 16:00:00 EDT 2018
```

(This assumes the current timezone since epoch times do not include timezone information.)

---

# Situations — Binary Data

Since JSON is text based and is encoded as utf-8 one cannot include binary
data directly, since binary data will invariably contain forbidden utf-8 byte sequences.

Work around this by converting the binary data into strings.
The most common way is as Base64, which translates the binary data into text that only
contains the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, `/`, and `=`. (This is 65 characters. why?).

```
"data": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
```

Most languages have packages to do base64 conversions. You can also do them on the command line
using the `base64` program (on Macs and Linux).

```
$ echo -n "hello world" | base64
aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=

$ echo -n "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=" | base64 --decode
hello world
```

# jq

There is a command line tool `jq` that is helpful for dealing with JSON data.

It can pretty-print a JSON file:

```
jq . input-file
```

You can also select certain data, and even build new JSON and non-JSON documents.

```
echo "[1,2,3]" | jq 'map(.+1)' #==> [2,3,4]
```

This tool is be very useful.

# Standards

JSON is defined as a standard RFC-8259 and ECMA-404.

```
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf
```

# Further Info

```
https://www.json.org/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON

```


---

# Literals

There are three literals:

```
false
true
null
```

All lowercase.


---

# Strings

A string starts with a double quote, and ends with a double quote.

```
"a string"
""              <------ empty string
```

## Details

Any unicode character can occur in between the double quotes except for:
a double quote, a backslash, a control character.
These special characters can be included by escaping them with a backslash

```
"This string \"needs\" double quotes"

"This is one line.\nAnd this is a second line"

"backslashes, \\, need to be escaped"
```

Can encode unicode using an escape if passing the JSON through a system that does not handle utf-8.

```
"\u214b \u2655 \u20bf" == "⅋ ♕ ₿"
```


---

# Numbers

A number is a sequence of numerals, with an optional decimal point and an optional exponential.

```
12
12.345
0.1234567890123456789
-6.022e23
0.0
-0
```

The numbers are interpreted as base 10 numerals.
JSON does not distinguish between different representations of the same number so
`12 == 12.0 == 1.2e1 == 0.12e2`
are all the same value.


---

# Objects

A JSON object is a collection of key-value pairs inside curly braces.

**Each key is a string,** followed by a colon and then a value.
Pairs are separated with commas. (But no trailing commas!)
The value can be any valid JSON expression.

```
{
    "key": {
        "name": "foo",
        "type": "bar"
    },
    "another key": 42
}

{}     <---- empty object
```


---

# Arrays

An array is an ordered sequence of values.
It is uses square braces, and separates values with commas.

```
[1, 2, 3]

[]    <----- empty array
```

The items in an array do not need to be of the same type:

```
[1, true, null, "foo", {"name":"foo"}, []]
```
