# JSON (and not Jason)

1. **J**ava**S**cript
2. **O**bject
3. **N**otation

It is a text-based format for data interchange between programs.

e.g. Between Server and Web browser

e.g. From Server to Server

e.g. From Today to Tomorrow (i.e. storage)


---

# What Does it Look Like?

```
{}

null

["apple", "banana", 55]

{"name":"Don", "height": 4.78e23}
```

---

# What are these?

There are 7 types of _values_ in a JSON document.

* an _object_
* an _array_
* a _number_
* a _string_
* `false`
* `true`
* `null`


Oh yeah, all interchanged JSON documents are also valid utf-8 documents.

---

# Literals

There are three literals:

```
false
true
null
```

They are encoded just like that. They are all lowercase.

What each means depends on the library you use to decode/encode JSON.
If the language has boolean values, `true` and `false` are usually mapped to those.
`null` usually to a null or nil pointer, if the language has them.

---

# Strings

A string starts with a double quote, and ends with a double quote.

```
"a string"
""              <------ empty string
```

Any unicode character can occur in between the double quotes except for:
a double quote, a backslash, a control character.
These special characters can be included by escaping them with a backslash

```
"This string \"needs\" double quotes"

"This is one line.\nAnd this is a second line"

"backslashes, \\, need to be escaped"
```

Can also encode unicode as an escape (e.g. if passing the JSON through a system that cannot handle utf-8).
Escape unicode as `\uXXXX`.

```
"\u214b \u2655 \u20bf" == "⅋ ♕ ₿"
```

For high code points, escape as though encoded as UTF-16. (whatever that means)


---

# Numbers

A number is a sequence of numerals, with an optional decimal point and an optional exponential.

```
12
12.345
0.1234567890123456789
-6.022e23
0.0
-0
```

The numbers are interpreted as base 10 numerals.
JSON does not distinguish between different representations of the same number so
`12 == 12.0 == 1.2e1 == 0.12e2`
are all the same value.

JSON does not distinguish between integers and floating point.
The standard also does not provide for a maximum, minimum, or floating point mantissa size.
(So...beware! For interoperability keep integers between -(2^53)+1 and (2^53)-1. Note that
this is smaller than the range of a 64 bit integer.
If need to send numbers bigger than 2^53, then send them as a base10 or base16 formatted string.)

Leading zeros are not allowed, with the excepetion of fractions. Then a zero is required before the decinal point
if there is no integer part.

---

# Objects

A JSON object is a collection of key-value pairs. It is introduced with curly braces.
Each key is a string, followed by a colon and then a value.
Pairs are separated with commas. (But no trailing commas!)
The value can be any valid JSON expression.

```
{
    "key": {
        "name": "foo",
        "type": "bar"
    },
    "another key": 42
}
```

The whitespace and newlines are not necessary. The standard permits, and does not
specify the meaning of, a key is being provided more than once. The following is valid:

```
{
    "Something": 5,
    "Something": false
}
```

A object with no pairs is the empty object:

```
{}
```


---

# Arrays

An array is an ordered sequence of values.
It is notated as an open square brace, a sequence of JSON values separated with commas, and then
a closing square brace.

```
[1, 2, 3]
```

The items in an array do not need to be of the same type:

```
[1, true, null, "foo", {"name":"foo"}, []]
```

# Quiz - Answers

Which of the following is valid JSON?


1. `NULL` - No. Wrong capatilization.
2. 012345 - No. Has leading zero.
3. `"False"` - Yes. This is a string. (compare with `false`).
4. `{}` - Yes.
5. `.567` - No. Needs zero before decimal.
6. `10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` - Yes.
7. `45e12345678902345` - Yes.
8. `-0.0` - Yes.
9. `NaN` - No.
10. `[2, 3, 4, ]` - No. Has trailing comma
11. `{"a": 46, "a": 34. }` - No. The decimal point is not followed by a numeral. (this is unfair, I didn't cover this in the previous slides!)
12. `{45: 2}` - No. Keys must be strings.
13. `{null: null}` - No. Keys must be strings.

# Situations - Dates

JSON does not include a date type. Usual way around this is to format dates
as a string in RFC 3339 or ISO-8601 format.

```
"2018-03-24T12:00:00-04"
```

Since the internet spans the world, it is important to include the timezone information in your times.
(Here it is the `-04` for EDT.)

Some APIs might use the number of seconds since midnight January 1, 1970 (aka the unix epoch).

```
1521921600
```

These are problematic since they do not include timezone information.

```
$ date -j -f "%s" 1521921600
Sat Mar 24 16:00:00 EDT 2018
```

---

# Situations - Binary Data

Since JSON is text based and is encoded as utf-8 one cannot include binary
data directly, since binary data will invariably contain forbidden utf-8 byte sequences.

One can work around this by encoding the binary data first. The most common way is
as Base64, which translates each 3 bytes of binary data into 4 characters from a 64
character alphabet (usually `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `+`, `/`, and `=`. and this is 65 characters!).

```
"data": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
```

Most languages have packages to do base64 conversions. You can also do them on the command line
using the `base64` program (on Macs and Linux).

```
echo -n "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=" | base64 --decode > output-file
```

---

# Situations - Numbers as Identifiers

Sometimes numbers are used to identify items, as not as a numeric measurement.
For example, we may want database record 478920. Or, in the library, each item in the
catalog has a record number such as 004648923.

In the first case, we may also represent that number as `47892e1` in JSON.
In the second case, numbers cannot have leading zeros in JSON. That could cause
problems if the receiving system is expecting the leading zeros.

In these cases, it is better to send the number as a _string_. e.g.

```
"478920"
"004648923"
```

Other identifiers may already contain dots or hyphens, and those of course need to be sent as strings.

```
"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
"v2.56"
```

(note: version numbers are especially tricky, since after v2.99 is v2.100. These as versions have a different
comparison relation than these as floating point numbers.)

# Situations - No Comments

You may have noticed that there is no way to comment out text in a JSON document.
This is not necessarily a drawback when using JSON for data interchange, but it can
be if programs use JSON for configuration.

One inelegant way around it is to make the comment a value to a key in an object.

```
{
    "_comment": "this is the first run testing data",
    "a": 1,
    ...
}
```

# JSON in the Wild

JSON tends to be found wherever data is exchanged over a network, or stored.

* As Responses to Web-based APIs
* Information stored in NoSQL databases (e.g. )
* In configuration files


# Extensions

There are many extensions of JSON for various applications.
(Paradoxically, the extensions actually define subsets of valid JSON documents.)

* JSON-LD - JSON representation of RDF Linked Data
* GeoJSON - JSON for representing shapes and maps

---

# JSON Trade-offs

Like any other technology, there are trade-offs with JSON

* It is text-based, so it is easy to inspect the data sent between programs.
* It has a well-defined encoding that has library support in a *lot* of programming languages
* The base64 encoding for binary content requires time to encode/decode and expands the size by 33%.
* However, many of web servers will send compressed JSON, so the size factor is mitigated.
* The stored data does not require any external knowledge to decoded it. (e.g. Decoder does not need to know that the first field is the author, the second is the date created, etc...)
* On other hand, if storing a lot of data, there can be a lot of redundancy since each object key will be repeated for each object. This can add up to a lot of storage.
* JSON cannot represent data with cycles or self references
* All newlines in JSON strings need to be escaped `\n`, which makes writing text in JSON difficult.

---

# Other kinds of Markup

There are other kinds of Markup that is similar to JSON.

* XML
* YAML
* BSON (Binary JSON)
* MessagePack (also binary)
* Protocol Buffers

These are only ones I have seen. There are many others.
They were created to serve different purposes, so they make different engineering trade-offs.

---

# jq

There is a command line tool `jq` that is helpful for dealing with JSON data.

The basic usage will pretty-print a JSON file:

```
jq . input-file
```

You can also select certain data, and even build new JSON and non-JSON documents.

```
echo "[1,2,3]" | jq 'map(.+1)' #==> [2,3,4]
```

This tool can be very useful.
```

# Trivia

While JSON is inspired by Javascript, there are valid JSON documents that are not valid Javascript documents.

Can you find one?


---

# Standards

JSON is defined as a standard RFC-8259. And also, concurrently, as ECMA-404.

```
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf
```

# Trivia - Answer

While JSON is inspired by Javascript, there are valid JSON documents that are not valid Javascript documents.

JSON allows U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR characters to be included directly in strings; Javascript requires them to be escaped.
